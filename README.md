Topic: the affecting of covid19 to IDR exchange rate and Forecasting IDR exchange rate by using VAR, CNN, LSTM, and  RNN
The final project proposal has some goals as follows
1. investigate the causality between the infected covid19 confirm to exchange rate
2. defime the suitable model structure
3. explore the affect of covid19 cases to exchange rare
4. modeling multiple time series using VAR, CNN, LSTM, and RNN
4. measure the model performance
